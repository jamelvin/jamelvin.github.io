I am a PhD Applied Math/MS Statistics currently performing scientific research in an academic setting.  I have extensive experience with Python and C++ and work on building mathematical and physical models for engineering problems. 

I have been an intern with the Apziva Artificial Intelligence (AI) Residency program expanding my machine learning and AI experience through industry relevant projects, which can be found her on my GitHub page. I am actively looking for data scientist or data analyst roles.
